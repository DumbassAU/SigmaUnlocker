# üíæ Installation
<details>
  <summary><h3>üë∂ This is my first time installing an Among Us mod</h3></summary>

## Windows
- Download `AUnlocker_v*.zip` from the latest release found [here](https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker/releases).

- Extract the contents of the zip into your Among Us folder.

    If you have AU on Steam, you can find the folder like this: Right-click AU in your library, click on `manage` and then on `browse local files`
   
- Launch Among Us. The first launch will take **MUCH** longer, so don't worry if you have to wait a few minutes.

## Linux
Check out [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) and [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html) to get BepInEx (framework AUnlocker is build upon) working. Then follow the steps for Windows.

  <summary><h3>üë¥ I installed one or more Among Us mods in the past</h3></summary>

- You should see a folder called `BepInEx` inside your Among Us folder. 
- Download `AUnlocker_v*.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker/releases), place it into `BepInEx/plugins` and launch Among Us.

This mod does not unlock all cosmetics **permanently**, so it does **not** add them to your account. This is because your progress is stored on the Innersloth servers and we cannot just modify it. However, this mod uses BepInEx and the Reactor Framework to Postfix Among Us game methods and unlock all cosmetics **temporarily**. If you uninstall this mod, the cosmetics will be locked again. The cosmetics you have already unlocked legitimately, e.g. through buying a cosmicube, are **untouched** by this mod.
