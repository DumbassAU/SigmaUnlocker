This mod does not unlock all cosmetics **permanently**, so it does **not** add them to your account. This is because your progress is stored on the Innersloth servers and we cannot just modify it. However, this mod uses BepInEx and the Reactor Framework to Postfix Among Us game methods and unlock all cosmetics **temporarily**. If you uninstall this mod, the cosmetics will be locked again. The cosmetics you have already unlocked legitimately, e.g. through buying a cosmicube, are **untouched** by this mod.
