## üêß Linux
Check out [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) and [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html) to get BepInEx (framework AUnlocker is built upon) working. Then follow the steps for Windows.

<hr>

<b>üëæ If you are already using other mods or already have BepInEx installed:</b>
- You should see a folder called `BepInEx` inside your Among Us folder. 
- Download `AUnlocker_v*.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker/releases/latest), place it into `BepInEx/plugins` and launch Among Us.

<b>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you don't want to download the pre-compiled DLL, you can build AUnlocker from source by following these steps:</b>
- Download the necessary files with `git clone https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker`
- Run the command `dotnet build` from the AUnlocker folder (where `AUnlocker.sln` is located)
- The compiled mod dll will be located here: `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/AUnlocker.dll`

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

AUnlocker does not unlock all cosmetics **permanently**, so it does **not** add them to your account. This is because your progress is stored on the Innersloth servers. If you uninstall this mod, the cosmetics will be locked again. The cosmetics you have already unlocked, e.g. through buying a cosmicube, are **untouched** by this mod.
