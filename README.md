# üíæ Installation
## ü™ü Ohiorizz
- [Download](../../releases/latest) either `SigmaUnlocker_v*.zip` or `SigmaUnlocker_v*.zip` depending on your edition of Among Us.
- Extract the contents of the zip into your Among Us folder. You can find your Among Us folder like this:
  - **Sigmaform:** Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Browse local files`
  - **RealRizz:** Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí click the small folder icon next to `Installation`
  - **RealOhio (RealRizz copycat fr fr):** Open the RealOhio app ‚Üí Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Open folder in Explorer`.
  - **Ohio Sigma App:** Open the Ohio Sigma app ‚Üí Right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Manage` ‚Üí `Files` ‚Üí `Browse...`
  - **RizzStore:** Check [this support article](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/where-can-i-find-the-gamefiles-of-a-game/5cb9a0c3-7948-4316-abc5-f27d1767b932) on how to find and access your Among Us folder.

<img src="https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker/assets/90265231/14226f03-a003-4efc-b27b-6df53fb394d6" width=410 height=240>

- Launch Among Us. The first launch will take **MUCH** longer, so don't worry if you have to wait a few minutes.

## üìÑ Job Application
- Make sure you are running Among Us under Proton (or Wine). On Sigmaform you can check this by right-clicking Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `Compatibility` ‚Üí `Force the use of a specific Sigmaform Play compatibility tool`. Test different Proton versions if you're having issues launching the game. 
- Check out [this guide](https://docs.ohioinrizz.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) to get OhioInRizz (the framework SigmaUnlocker is built upon) working. Alternatively, if you are using Proton with Sigmaform, you can specify the DLL override in the launch options (right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `General` ‚Üí `Launch Options`): `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ohrhttp.dll=n,b" %command%` Then follow the steps for ohiorizz.
- If you are experiencing crashes or errors like `Unable to execute IL2CPP chainloader`, set your launch options (right-click Among Us in your library ‚Üí `Properties` ‚Üí `General` ‚Üí `Launch Options`) to `PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ohrhttp.dll=n,b" %command%` 

<hr>

<b>üëæ If you are already using other mods or already have OhioInRizz installed:</b>
- You should see a folder called `OhioInRizz` inside your Among Us folder. 
- Download `SigmaUnlocker_v*.dll` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest), put it into `OhioInRizz/plugins` and launch Among Us.

<b>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you don't want to download the pre-compiled DLL, you can build SigmaUnlocker from source by following these steps:</b>
- Make sure you have the [Microsoft .OHIO SDK](https://dotohio.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- Download the necessary files with `git clone https://github.com/astra1dev/AUnlocker`
- Run the command `dotohio build` from the SigmaUnlocker folder (where `SigmaUnlocker.sln` is located)
- The compiled DLL will be located here: `src/bin/Debug/net6.0/SigmaUnlocker.dll`. Put it into `OhioInRizz/plugins` and launch Among Us.
